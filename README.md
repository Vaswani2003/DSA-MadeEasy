# 🧠 DSA Problem-Solving Patterns Cheat Sheet

A curated set of strategies to quickly identify and solve common types of Data Structures & Algorithms problems. Use this guide when stuck or starting a new problem.

---

## 📦 If the input array is **sorted**
- **Binary Search**: Use when you need to find an element or boundary fast.
- **Two Pointers**: Ideal for pair-sum, duplicates removal, and subarray problems.
- **Sliding Window**: Great for continuous segment analysis (e.g., max sum of k elements).

---

## 🔁 If dealing with **permutations, subsets, combinations**
- **Backtracking**: Systematically generate all possibilities.
- **Bitmasking**: Efficient for subsets, toggling elements, or tracking states (esp. when N ≤ 20).
- **Heap/Set with Backtracking**: Use to handle duplicates.

---

## 🌳 If the input is a **tree**
- **DFS**: Preferred for calculating depths, subtree sums, ancestor tracking.
- **BFS**: Useful for level-wise processing (e.g., right view, zigzag traversal).
- **Post-order Traversal**: When you need child info before parent (e.g., deleting nodes).
- **In-order Traversal**: When BST properties are relevant (e.g., kth smallest).

---

## 🔗 If input is a **linked list**
- **Fast & Slow Pointers**: Detect cycles, find midpoints, or split lists.
- **Dummy Head Technique**: Simplifies edge cases in insertion/removal.
- **Reversal + Comparison**: Use for palindrome detection or reordering.

---

## 🌐 If input is a **graph**
- **DFS**: Cycle detection, component labeling, topological sort.
- **BFS**: Shortest path in unweighted graphs (e.g., Word Ladder).
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Shortest path in weighted graphs.
- **Union-Find (Disjoint Set)**: Connected components, cycle detection in undirected graphs.
- **Topological Sort**: For scheduling, dependency resolution (DAGs only).
- **Floyd-Warshall / Bellman-Ford**: When negative weights are involved.

---

## 🧱 If recursion is **not allowed**
- **Explicit Stack**: Simulate recursion, especially in DFS or tree traversal.
- **Morris Traversal**: For in-order tree traversal with O(1) space.
- **Iterative DP**: Convert recursive solutions to bottom-up tabulation.

---

## ♻️ If the problem must be **in-place**
- **Two Pointers (read/write)**: Removing duplicates, rearranging elements.
- **Cyclic Sort**: Place elements at correct indices when values are within known range.
- **Bit Manipulation**: Track multiple states in limited space.
- **Index as Marker**: Negate or offset values to track visited indices.

---

## 📊 If the problem involves **frequencies or counting**
- **Hash Map / Counter**: Track counts of elements (e.g., anagram detection).
- **Prefix Sum / Difference Array**: Range queries, overlapping intervals.
- **Bucket Sort / Counting Sort**: Useful when values are bounded and large N.

---

## 🎯 If asked for **max/min in subarray or window**
- **Sliding Window**: Best for fixed-size windows.
- **Deque (Monotonic Queue)**: Get max/min in a window in `O(n)` time.
- **Segment Tree / Fenwick Tree**: For dynamic range queries/updates.

---

## 🔢 If asked for **top/least K elements**
- **Min/Max Heap**: Track top/least elements.
- **QuickSelect**: Efficient selection algorithm to get the k-th element.
- **Counting Sort**: If input values are integers within a limited range.

---

## 🔠 If asked for **common strings, substrings, or prefixes**
- **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: Best for prefix searches and autocomplete.
- **Hash Set**: Detect duplicates or common elements.
- **Rolling Hash (Rabin-Karp)**: For substring matching or deduplication.
- **Suffix Array / LCP**: Advanced, for repeated substring analysis.

---

## 🧭 If the question is about **searching paths**
- **DFS/BFS**: Navigate paths in tree or graph.
- **Backtracking**: For exploring multiple paths (e.g., word search).
- **A\***: When heuristic-based pathfinding is needed.
- **Union-Find**: Check if two nodes are connected.

---

## 💰 If asked to **optimize cost or profit**
- **Greedy**: Works when local optimal leads to global optimal (e.g., activity selection, Huffman coding).
- **Dynamic Programming**: Use when greedy fails or overlapping subproblems exist.
- **Knapsack Pattern**: Subset selection under constraints.

---

## 📈 If asked for **increasing/decreasing sequences**
- **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: Can be done in `O(n log n)` using binary search + DP.
- **Patience Sorting / Binary Search on Tails**: Efficient LIS trick.
- **Stack**: Used for problems like "Next Greater Element".

---

## 🧮 If problem has **mathematical constraints**
- **Modular Arithmetic**: For large number calculations.
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Efficient prime number generation.
- **Prefix GCD/LCM Arrays**: For range queries.

---

## 🧪 Miscellaneous Patterns
- **Greedy + Sorting**: Many greedy problems rely on sorting by some metric.
- **DFS + Memoization (Top-down DP)**: For recursion-heavy problems with overlapping subproblems.
- **Bitmask DP**: For subset states (e.g., traveling salesman, team formation).
- **Meet in the Middle**: For exponential problems where N ≈ 30.
- **Mo’s Algorithm**: For offline range query optimization.
- **Binary Search on Answer**: When answer lies in a numeric range, not index.

---

## 🧠 General Tips
- Always check **constraints**: 
  - If `n ≤ 10`, brute force is acceptable.
  - If `n ≤ 20`, consider **bitmasking**.
  - If `n ≤ 1000`, use `O(n²)` solutions.
  - If `n ≤ 10⁵`, aim for `O(n log n)` or better.
- Prefer **Hashing** over nested loops when possible.
- Dry-run on **small examples** to find patterns.
- Memorize a few **template problems** from each category.
